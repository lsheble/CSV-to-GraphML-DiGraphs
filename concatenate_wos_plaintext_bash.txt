In the same directory as a bunch of wos plaintext files:
cat *.txt >> <outfile1>.txt
sed '/EFFN Thomson Reuters /,/VR 1.0/d' <outfile1>.txt > <outfile2>.txt

The first line concatenates all files that end with .txt and writes them to a new file named CogNeuroSci. 
The original files remain.

For the second part, we take advantage of a neat thing that happens when we concatenate the files:

The file header:
FN Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge™
VR 1.0 

Is appended immediately after end of file marker 
EF
By our concatenation line, 
thereby producing:
EFFN Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge™
VR 1.0
In this case, it simplifies removing the beginning and end of file text:
At the true beginning of concatenated files result, the beginning of file text remains:
FN Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge
VR 1.0
and also the end of file text remains at true end:
EF
while all the inbetween end and beginning of file texts were joined together:
EFFN Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge
VR 1.0
 
Therefore, we can use sed & indicate the beginning and end of the text block we want to remove & 
don’t have to worry about otherwise treating the first of these at the beginning of the big file & 
the last at the end of big file differently.

here’s the general form:
sed "/startOfBlock/,/endOfBlock/d" file.txt > outfile
And this is an example I used with one of our data sets:
sed '/EFFN Thomson Reuters /,/VR 1.0/d' CogNeuroSci_raw.txt > CogNeuroSci_raw_clean.txt
